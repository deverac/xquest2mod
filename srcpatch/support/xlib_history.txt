This document gives a short history of XLIB used in XQuest2.

[XLIB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xlib) is a protocol/library for interacting
with an X Server. In a simple sense, XLIB provides methods for drawing on a
screen. e.g. The `XLine()` procedure draws a line on the screen.

Themie Gouthas (and other contributors) implemented parts of the XLIB spec in
the C language to run on DOS to allow graphics programs to take full advantage
of the VGA hardware.

Tristan Tarrant converted selected portions of the C version of XLIB to
Turbo/Borland Pascal.

Mark 'AtomJack' Mackey, the author of XQuest2, modified the Turbo/Borland
Pascal version of XLIB to suit the needs of XQuest2.

Among the modifications are:

    * Added XMODETEXT

    * Added SCROFFSETTABLE

    * XSetMode() returns an Integer, rather than a Word.

    * When calling XTextMode(), the CurrXMode is updated.

    * Parameters of XLine() were swapped:

         Before: XLine(x1, y1, x2, y2, Color, PgOffs)
         After : XLine(x1, y1, x2, y2, PgOffs, Color)

    * XSetDoubleBuffer() was changed from a Procedure to a Function.

    * Some assembly instructions were altered:

         Before: xchg bx,VisiblePageOffs
         After : xchg VisiblePageOffs,bx

Other code modifications were also made.

When Mark Mackey released the source code of XQuest2, the release included
XLIB.TPU, a compiled version of Mark Mackey's modified XLIB library. The release
did not include the source file, XLIB.PAS, which was used to generate XLIB.TPU.

The XLIB.TPU file is a binary format created by the Turbo Pascal 6 compiler
when it compiled the XLIB.PAS unit. Turbo Pascal 7 also creates TPU files when
it compiles units, but it uses a different internal format than Turbo Pascal 6.
No other compiler, including Turbo Pascal 7, could read/use the XLIB.TPU file
created by Turbo Pascal 6.

What this meant is that since XLIB.TPU was created by Turbo Pascal 6, the
*only* way that XQUEST.EXE could be built was to compile the XQuest2 sources
using Turbo Pascal 6.

Fortunately, the
[intrfc70.zip](http://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/pc/garbo/pc/turbopas/intrfc70.zip)
utility exists. The intrfc utility is able to read a TPU file and dump its
binary content in a meaningful manner. It can output the names, the arguments,
and the binary code of each method stored in the TPU file.

The intrfc tool, along with Tristan Tarrant's XLIB Pascal source files, allowed
[deverac](https://github.com/deverac) to re-create Mark Mackey's 'missing'
XLIB.PAS file. When the re-created XLIB.PAS file was compiled with Turbo
Pascal 6, it generated an XLIB.TPU file containing methods that were
bit-for-bit identical to the XLIB.TPU file that was released with XQuest2
sources.

Once the 'missing' XLIB.PAS had been recreated, deverac modified the XQuest2
source code so that it could be compiled with
[Free Pascal Compiler](https://www.freepascal.org/).

The end result of this is XQUEST.EXE can now be built with Turbo Pascal 6,
Turbo Pascal 7, or cross-compiled with Free Pascal Compiler on Linux.



Fun fact: XQuest2 was included on the CD that was distributed with
[PC Zone Issue 39 July 1996](https://www.pixsoriginadventures.co.uk/PCZone/PC%20Zone%2039%20(June%201996)/)
The 'XQUEST 2' name also appears in PC Zone Issue 40 July 1996 on page 119,
which contains a picture of the CD cover included in Issue 39.

To access the CD image from pixsoriginadventures.co.uk on Linux:

    $ unrar-nonfree x CDZone#39.rar         Decompress image (`unrar-free` did not work)
    $ ccd2iso CDZone#39.img cdzone39.iso    Convert img format to iso format
    # mount -o loop cdzone39.iso /mnt       Mount iso image
